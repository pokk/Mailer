# Mailer
This is a script for mailing to someone. If you always forget attaching some attachments for sending the same content in an email, you can try to use my script.

# Using
Please don't change the files' path.

Note: If you really want to change it. You can modify code by yourself. ^_^

## Set your id and password for your mail server
There is a json file which has your login information for login specific mail server.
You can change 'uid' and 'pwd' to yours.

## Mac command file
This  "__Send Mail.command__" is for MAC.


Then ...., no then. Just easy to use it.
